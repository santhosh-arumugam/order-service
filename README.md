**Order Service**

# **Order Service for SwiftCart**

**The Order Service is a core component of the SwiftCart e-commerce platform, responsible for managing customer orders, order items, and event logging in a microservices architecture. It handles order creation, status tracking, cancellation, and event emission for integration with other services (e.g., Payment, Inventory, Shipping, Notification). Built with Spring Boot, Java 17, PostgreSQL, and Kafka, the service ensures real-time processing, fault tolerance, and observability.**
